# oauth

For now, this is a placeholder repository.

Like most people, I do not want to implement login on my own, so this will use Google/GitHub to authenticate users
for some things in the future.

There's already infra for this in the dozen backend services I've got holding this in place, and I got tired of `git clone`
errors bloating up my CI/CD logs, hence this placeholder.

If someone who's not me ends up seeing this and has an implementation in mind, start a discussion and get involved. Any help
is appreciated.

Cheers,
